 As a Team member:

	. I Created a new java project named, TeamCollab
	. I enabled Git from the VCS menu so that it plays the bridge role between IntelliJ and GitHub.
	. I Created a .gitignore file and added the following  main folders to ignore (so that, they could be ignored by the GitHub)files: out, *.iml, .idea

	 .I Created the remote repository by sharing the project on
	 Git -> GitHub -> Share Project on GitHub.
	 . I Created a new branch from origin-master called develop by clicking the master, typed the word, develop in the (Find or Create a branch) box  and clicked create develop underneath the box on the remote repository.

	 . I Invited you and some of our team members by going to project settings -> Access - clicked Collaborators -> Add people and waiting until make sure everyone accepted the invitation to collaborate together.
